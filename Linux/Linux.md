# Linux

A collection of scripts i wrote to simplify my Linux-Journey.



## ArchLinux.sh (TODO, does not work in it's current state!!!)

A script that installs ArchLinux the way i want it to. This script is very subjectiv and most of the installation is hardcoded. If you're looking for a way to automate the installation of ArchLinux, you may want to check out "archinstall".

> A working internet connection and superuser permissions are required!

| Arguments | Description |
|--|--|
| -b |  basic installation only|
|-g| graphical installation (gnome-desktop)|
|-s| output information about the repository
|-h| outputs a simple help dialog
